# Game-Scripts

This archive is a compilation of various scripts used in Unity game development projects. Each script is designed to perform a specific task or function in Unity, making it an excellent resource for new game developers

## Overview

This repository contains scripts arranged according to the games they were created for. They have been named and organised in a manner that reflects the theme of each game. For example, if the game is called "Strike 42," which is a first-person shooter (FPS) game, the script names have been added accordingly.
